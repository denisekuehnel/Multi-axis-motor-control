# Multi-axis-motor-control
Driver for TMCM-6110 as a multi-axis stepper motor controller.


The motivation behind this project is to be able to set up a device-independet system for multi-axis motor control, more specifically the conduction of combinatorial research. However, the implemented driver provides the base for that goal. There is no actual automation yet. Commands for the motor such as “move to position” have to be done manually.
For that purpose a GUI is included, which allows for the adaptation of base parameters, as well as carry out the “move to position”, “motor stop” and “reference search” commands.
